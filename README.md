# Software-Tools-Angular-Banking-App

## This project was based on our Dev Ops module. We used slack, Azure Pipelines and worked in teams of two to develop skills in application development in a real life scenario.

The app is not finished, but the code is there for the most part. We made a presentation to our professor showcasing the app, the process of development and used Azure to simulate dev ops of this app. The workflow was making a component, integration, testing and documenting it via slack communication to ensure every piece was made with purpose from db config to component integration and final demo. The app had simple screens or tabs which swapped between showing users data in a profile and their transactions which were hardcoded in a db. We ran out of time to finish it, however the professor did not want anyone to finish their apps. He was looking for teamwork, which we proved to portray well.

Excuse the comit messages, this was just for simplicity as we were not marked on github skills in this module.
